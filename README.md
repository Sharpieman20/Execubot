# Execubot

This is the main repository for my submission to Solana's Riptide Hackathon.\
\
The code for the TWAP bot lives in this repo, and more information on testing and usage can be found in BOT.md.\
\
The other main component of my project is research into improving execution using this bot.\
\
I've written Medium articles here with my findings:\
Quantifying Price Impact - <link>\
Analyzing Techniques for Improving Execution Performance - <link>\
\
The code used to produce these results is also available upon request.\
