# Execubot

This is the main repository for my submission to Solana's Riptide Hackathon.\
\
The code for the Serum Twap bot lives in this repo, and more information on testing and usage can be found in [BOT.md](BOT.md).\
\
The other main component of my project is research into improving execution using this bot.\
\
I've written Medium articles here with my findings:\
Quantifying PriceÂ Impact - https://medium.com/@sharpieman20/quantifying-price-impact-6160fdb1dff1
Analyzing Techniques for Improving Execution Performance - https://medium.com/@sharpieman20/evaluating-techniques-for-improving-execution-performance-20d68e8a11b2
\
The code used to produce these results is also available upon request.
