# Execubot

This is the main repository for my submission to Solana's Riptide Hackathon.

The code for the TWAP bot lives in this repo, and more information on testing and usage can be found in BOT.md.

The other main component of my project is research into improving execution using this bot.

I've written Medium articles here with my findings:
Quantifying PriceÂ Impact - <link>
Analyzing Techniques for Improving Execution Performance - <link>

The code used to produce these results is also available upon request.
